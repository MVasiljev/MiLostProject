# Gesture Recognition System

## Overview

The `gesture_recognition.rs` file implements the gesture recognition system for the MiLost UI framework. It analyzes low-level touch and pointer events to identify higher-level gestures such as taps, swipes, long presses, and multi-touch interactions. This module converts primitive input events into semantic gesture events that are more meaningful for application logic.

## Key Components

### `GestureRecognitionConfig` Struct

Configures the sensitivity and thresholds for gesture detection:

- Timing thresholds (tap duration, double tap interval, long press duration).
- Distance thresholds (tap max distance, swipe min distance).
- Velocity thresholds (swipe min velocity).
- Scaling thresholds (pinch min scale change).
- Rotation thresholds (rotate min angle).

### `GesturePayload` Struct

Contains detailed information about recognized gestures:

- Start and end positions.
- Duration of the gesture.
- Velocity of movement.
- Additional gesture-specific details.

### `GestureRecognizer` Struct

The core component that analyzes input events and detects gestures:

- Maintains a history of touch events.
- Tracks state for multi-touch and sequential gestures.
- Contains detection algorithms for each supported gesture.
- Converts raw events to gesture events.

## Key Methods and Functions

### Initialization

- `GestureRecognizer::new(config)`: Creates a new recognizer with optional custom configuration.

### Event Processing

- `process_event(event)`: Main entry point for processing raw events.
- `update_touch_history(event)`: Updates the internal event history.
- `handle_touch_start(event)`, `handle_touch_move(event)`, `handle_touch_end(event)`: Event-type-specific handlers.

### Gesture Detection

- `detect_tap()`: Identifies tap gestures including double taps.
- `detect_long_press()`: Identifies press-and-hold interactions.
- `detect_swipe()`: Recognizes directional swipe gestures.
- (Implied but not implemented in the snippet) Methods for detecting pinch, rotate, and other complex gestures.

## Detection Algorithm Overview

### Tap Detection

1. Measure duration between touch start and end.
2. Calculate distance between start and end positions.
3. If duration and distance are within thresholds, classify as a tap.
4. Track tap count and timing for double-tap detection.

### Long Press Detection

1. Measure duration between touch start and end.
2. Calculate distance to ensure minimal movement.
3. If duration exceeds threshold and movement is minimal, classify as long press.

### Swipe Detection

1. Calculate distance and direction between start and end positions.
2. Measure duration and calculate velocity.
3. If distance, duration, and velocity meet thresholds, classify as a swipe.
4. Determine swipe direction based on movement vector.
5. Track multi-swipe sequences for compound gestures.

## Usage Patterns

1. **Configuration**: The recognizer is configured with appropriate thresholds for the application.
2. **Event Feeding**: Raw touch/pointer events are fed into the recognizer.
3. **Gesture Recognition**: The recognizer analyzes event patterns to identify gestures.
4. **Gesture Events**: Recognized gestures generate higher-level events with rich metadata.
5. **Application Handling**: The application responds to semantic gesture events.

## Integration Points

- Consumes raw events from `event_system.rs`.
- Uses event types and structures from `event_types.rs`.
- Produces gesture events that are dispatched through the event handler system.
- Connected to the renderer for position-based gesture detection.
- Used by components to respond to complex interactions.

## Example Flow

1. A user performs a swiping motion on the screen.
2. The system generates a series of TouchStart, TouchMove, and TouchEnd events.
3. These events are fed into the GestureRecognizer.
4. The recognizer analyzes the movement pattern, duration, and velocity.
5. If the pattern matches a swipe, a Swipe event is generated with direction and velocity data.
6. The Swipe event is dispatched to appropriate handlers in the component hierarchy.

## Future Improvements

1. **Additional Gesture Support**:

   - Implement pinch-to-zoom gesture detection.
   - Add rotation gesture recognition.
   - Support multi-finger gestures (three-finger swipe, four-finger pinch).
   - Add custom gesture definition capabilities.

2. **Advanced Recognition Algorithms**:

   - Implement machine learning-based gesture recognition.
   - Add support for path-based gestures (circles, squares, etc.).
   - Improve accuracy with predictive algorithms.
   - Implement adaptive thresholds based on user behavior.

3. **Performance Optimizations**:

   - Optimize event history management for memory efficiency.
   - Implement early rejection of non-gesture patterns.
   - Add spatial indexing for multi-touch gesture recognition.

4. **Multi-Device Support**:

   - Add device-specific gesture recognition parameters.
   - Support for different input characteristics (stylus vs. finger).
   - Implement adaptive parameters based on device capabilities.

5. **Accessibility Enhancements**:
   - Add support for accessible gesture alternatives.
   - Implement customizable gesture sensitivity for users with motor impairments.
   - Support switch-based gesture simulation.
   - Add haptic feedback integration.
