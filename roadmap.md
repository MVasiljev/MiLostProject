# MiLost UI System: Achievements and Next Steps

## What We've Accomplished

### Rust Side

1. Created a modular layout engine that calculates positions and sizes for UI components
2. Implemented a platform-agnostic rendering system with clear separation of concerns
3. Created an abstraction for drawing contexts via the `DrawingContext` trait
4. Built a canvas renderer that uses this abstraction for rendering to HTML Canvas
5. Maintained clear boundaries between UI logic (ui crate) and WASM bindings (wasm crate)
6. Implemented basic component layout algorithms for VStack, HStack, ZStack, etc.

### TypeScript Side

1. Updated the MiLostRenderer to use canvas-based rendering
2. Implemented event handling for interactive components like buttons
3. Fixed builder pattern to work with both builders and built UI objects
4. Created hit-testing mechanism for determining what component was clicked

## Next Steps

### Rust Improvements

1. Complete implementation of remaining UI components (Divider, Image, Spacer)
2. Improve layout engine to handle more complex layout scenarios (flex-based sizing)
3. Add support for more styling options (borders, shadows, gradients)
4. Implement better text measurement for accurate text layout
5. Create a more robust event system in Rust instead of relying on global JS functions
6. Add animation support
7. Implement image loading and rendering
8. Add more color options and gradient support

### TypeScript Improvements

1. Create a proper React component wrapper for MiLostRenderer
2. Move initialization logic from main.ts into the renderer
3. Implement a proper event delegation system that doesn't rely on window globals
4. Add TypeScript types for all render node structures
5. Improve error handling and debugging capabilities
6. Create a development mode with visual debugging tools

### Integration Points

1. Create a proper SEO/metadata injection system that doesn't interfere with rendering
2. Implement server-side rendering capabilities
3. Add support for accessibility features (ARIA attributes)
4. Create a more robust event handling system that's managed by Rust
5. Add proper lifecycle hooks (mount, unmount, update)

### Build and Infrastructure

1. Improve the build process to optimize WASM size
2. Add comprehensive testing for both Rust and TypeScript code
3. Create documentation for the API and component system
4. Implement version compatibility checks between Rust and JS

Let's tackle these in our next conversation, focusing first on completing the remaining UI components and improving the event handling system.
